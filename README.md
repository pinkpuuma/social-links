# Challenge 3 from Frontend Mentor

## Tools and Frameworks:

Astro, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, Vercel

## Skills Used:

Flexbox, responsive layout with Tailwind utility classes. Hover utility classes.

## Challenges:

This felt like the easiest challenge yet. That is because flexbox is becoming much more second hand. Albiet a simple design, initial layout is much more intuitive.
The biggest challenge here was figuring out how to template each "button" link and calling them back to index.astro.
